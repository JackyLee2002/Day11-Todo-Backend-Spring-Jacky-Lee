O: Having experience integrating backend and frontend systems, configuring CORS settings, and possessing basic cloud knowledge, the tools and concepts needed in configuring such integrations are not new to me. 

R: Repetitive

I: Settings like CORS are required when integrating any backend and frontend application. And for Spring Boot's CORS settings, be it with Spring Web MVC or with Spring Security, the boilerplate codes used are still very similar and repetitive except for changing the urls. Integrating frontend and backend systems requires a lot of cooperation and testing from engineers in order to ensure the result is satisfactory. 

D: To streamline the integration process and reduce the repetitive nature of configuring CORS settings, I plan to create a set of reusable templates and scripts. These will standardize the setup across different projects, minimizing the need for repetitive code changes.
